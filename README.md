# EmbeddedSystemProject
I engineered an ESP32-based onboard computer with diverse features: shift register, sound, RTC, doors control, temperature sensing, CAN communication, indications, HMI, lights control, MUX modules, and efficient battery management.
Project Description:

I undertook a comprehensive project to transform an ESP32 into a versatile onboard computer, equipping it with an array of functionalities to enhance its capabilities. This ambitious endeavor involved integrating a wide range of features, ensuring seamless operation and real-time communication within the system.

Key Implementations:

    Shift Register Integration: The project incorporated a shift register, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval processes, enhancing the system's data management and processing capabilities.

    Sound Functionality: I implemented sound functionalities, allowing for audio alerts and feedback, contributing to the system's user-friendliness and enhancing the overall user experience.

    Real-time Clock (RTC): A real-time clock module was integrated to ensure precise timekeeping, enabling the system to display accurate timestamps and synchronize various time-dependent functions.

    Doors Control: The system was equipped with door control mechanisms, ensuring secure access control and providing essential safety features.

    Temperature Sensing (LM75): Temperature monitoring was achieved through the integration of the LM75 sensor, ensuring accurate climate control within the system.

    CAN Communication: To facilitate seamless communication between components, Controller Area Network (CAN) communication was established, enabling efficient data exchange among system modules.

    Indication System: An indication system was designed and implemented, allowing the onboard computer to relay critical information through intuitive visual cues.

    Human-Machine Interface (HMI): The project featured an intuitive HMI, enabling users to interact with the system effortlessly, access vital information, and control various functionalities.

    Lights Control: The system included dynamic lights control, ensuring optimal visibility and providing additional safety features.

    Mux Modules: Multiplexer (MUX) modules were incorporated to streamline data routing and signal processing, enhancing the system's efficiency and responsiveness.

    Battery Management: The project also focused on efficient battery management, optimizing power consumption to extend the system's runtime and reliability.
To implement this modules, I used Common Data file for shared variables and EEPROM module vor variablem that should be kept after the restart of the board (time, indications etc.)
This project represents a holistic approach to system development, combining hardware integration, software implementation, and communication protocols to create a sophisticated onboard computer system. The successful integration of these functionalities, including battery management, demonstrates a deep understanding of embedded systems and a commitment to delivering innovative solutions for real-world applications.
